## KNOWN LIMITATIONS (DOCUMENTED)

### Minor Limitations
- ⚠️ Single shared enrollment secret (no per-agent revocation)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on login (mitigated by strong passwords)
- ⚠️ No CSRF tokens beyond SameSite protection (sufficient for lab)
- ⚠️ Database not encrypted at rest (acceptable for lab networks)

### By Design
- 🔒 No remote keyboard/mouse control (read-only monitoring only)
- 🔒 Power operations require dry-run mode by default
- 🔒 All power commands logged for audit

### Deferred to Future
- 📋 Per-agent enrollment tokens
- 📋 Rate limiting middleware
- 📋 Database encryption (SQLCipher)
- 📋 Secrets rotation mechanism
- 📋 External secrets manager integration

# WINDOWS MANUAL TEST — START HERE

## Exact Commands for Windows (Copy & Paste Ready)

### ON SERVER PC (Windows 10/11)

**Step 1: Open PowerShell and navigate to project**
```powershell
cd "D:\DC Project\LabManagement"
```

**Step 2: Create virtual environment**
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

**Step 3: Activate virtual environment**
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
*If you get an execution policy error, run this first:*
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

**Step 4: Install dependencies**
```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 5: Create .env file**
Generate secrets (run each command once and save output):
```powershell
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
```

Create `.env` file in the project directory with content:
```
LAB_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
LAB_SERVER_PORT=8000
LAB_APP_SECRET=PASTE_FIRST_SECRET_HERE
LAB_AGENT_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=PASTE_SECOND_SECRET_HERE
LAB_INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
LAB_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=TestLab2025
LAB_POWER_DRY_RUN=true
LAB_SECURE_COOKIES=false
LAB_DATABASE_PATH=labmanagement.sqlite3
```

**Step 6: Find your server's LAN IP**
```powershell
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your network adapter (usually 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). **Write it down** - you need it for agent setup.

**Step 7: Configure Windows Firewall**
Run in **Administrator PowerShell**:
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "LabManagement Server" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8000 -Profile Private -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

**Step 8: Start the server**
```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH="."
python -m server.main
```

Expected output:
```
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Keep this terminal open and running!**

---

### ON AGENT PC (Windows 10/11)

**Step 1: Copy the LabManagement project folder**
Copy from server to agent PC at same location (e.g., `D:\DC Project\LabManagement`)

**Step 2: Open PowerShell and navigate to project**
```powershell
cd "D:\DC Project\LabManagement"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

**Step 3: Run the automated setup script**
```powershell
.\deploy\windows\setup_agent.ps1
```

**Step 4: When prompted, enter:**
- **Server LAN URL**: Enter the IP from Step 6 above, e.g.: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`
- **Agent Enrollment Token**: Copy the value of `LAB_AGENT_ENROLLMENT_SECRET` from server's `.env` file

**Step 5: Start the agent**
```powershell
.\deploy\windows\start_agent.bat
```

Expected output (agent shows):
```
2026-09-01 XX:XX:XX INFO Agent initialization starting...
2026-09-01 XX:XX:XX INFO Connected to server http://192.168.1.100:8000
2026-09-01 XX:XX:XX INFO Agent registered: [UUID]
2026-09-01 XX:XX:XX INFO Heartbeat sent successfully
```

**Keep this terminal open and running!**

---

### ON SERVER PC - BROWSER TEST

**Step 1: Open web browser**
```
http://localhost:8000/
```

You should be redirected to login page automatically.

**Step 2: Login as admin**
- Username: `admin` (or your LAB_INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME)
- Password: `TestLab2025` (or your LAB_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD)
- Click "Sign In"

**Step 3: Verify agent appears in dashboard**
Look at the "Computer Inventory" table. Your agent PC should appear with:
- Status: `🟢 ONLINE` (green)
- Hostname: (your computer name)
- IP Address: (visible)
- Operating System: Windows
- Last Heartbeat: (just now)

**If agent does NOT appear:**
- Check agent terminal for errors
- Verify network: `ping 192.168.1.100` from agent PC
- Verify enrollment token matches exactly
- Check server logs for connection errors

**Step 4: Test live screen viewing (optional)**
1. Click on agent row in dashboard
2. Click "📺 View Live Screen"
3. Wait 2-3 seconds for connection
4. You should see a live screenshot of the agent desktop
5. Try moving mouse on agent PC - screen should update
6. Close screen viewer

**Step 5: Test dry-run power operation (optional)**
1. Click agent row, then click "↻ Restart"
2. Confirm in the dialog
3. Watch agent terminal - shows it RECEIVED the command but did NOT restart (dry-run)
4. Check "Activity & Audit Log" shows the power command

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Python not found" | Install Python 3.12 from python.org, check "Add Python to PATH" |
| Activation script fails | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` first |
| "pip: command not found" | Python wasn't added to PATH; reinstall checking the PATH checkbox |
| Agent won't connect | Check server IP is correct in agent setup; verify firewall rule added |
| Agent appears OFFLINE | Check network: `ping SERVER_IP` from agent PC |
| Dashboard shows blank | Check server console for errors; try refreshing browser (F5) |
| Port 8000 already in use | Different app is using port 8000; either stop it or use different port |
| Firewall blocks connection | Run firewall rule command as Administrator in PowerShell |
