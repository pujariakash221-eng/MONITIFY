# Manual LAN Test Procedure
## Computer Lab Management Platform - Windows Release Testing

This document contains **exact step-by-step procedures** for testing the LabManagement system across multiple machines on a local area network (LAN) after switching to Windows environment.

**Equipment Needed:**
- Server PC (Windows/Linux) - runs the central FastAPI server
- At least 1 Workstation PC (Windows) - runs the lab agent
- Network connectivity between both machines on the same subnet
- Administrator access on Windows systems
- Approximately 30-45 minutes for complete test cycle

## PHASE A: SERVER PC SETUP

### Step A1: Find Server LAN IP Address

**On Windows Server PC:**
1. Open Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) or PowerShell
2. Run:
   ```cmd
   ipconfig
   ```
3. Look for your network adapter (Ethernet or Wi-Fi)
4. Find the `IPv4 Address` line (typically `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x`)
5. **Record this IP** - you will need it on workstation agents

**Example Output:**
```
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix: example.com
   IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.100
   Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

**Your Server IP: _____________** (write it down)

### Step A2: Verify Project Files

On the server PC, verify the LabManagement project is properly copied:
```cmd
cd LabManagement
dir
```

Expected files/folders: `server`, `agent`, `dashboard`, `deploy`, `tests`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`

### Step A3: Create .env Configuration File

1. Open `.env.example` in a text editor
2. Copy its contents and create a new file called `.env`
3. Set strong secrets:
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print('APP_SECRET: ' + secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
   python -c "import secrets; print('ENROLLMENT_SECRET: ' + secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
   ```
4. Edit `.env` with these values:
   ```
   LAB_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
   LAB_SERVER_PORT=8000
   LAB_APP_SECRET=<generated_secret_from_python>
   LAB_AGENT_ENROLLMENT_SECRET=<generated_secret_from_python>
   LAB_INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
   LAB_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=TestLab2025!
   LAB_POWER_DRY_RUN=true
   LAB_SECURE_COOKIES=false
   LAB_DATABASE_PATH=labmanagement.sqlite3
   ```

### Step A4: Start the Central Server

**Option 1: PowerShell (Recommended for Windows)**
```powershell
cd d:\DC Project\LabManagement
python -m server.main
```

**Option 2: Command Prompt**
```cmd
cd d:\DC Project\LabManagement
python -m server.main
```

Expected output:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
INFO:     Application startup complete
```

### Step A5: Verify Server Health (On Server PC)

Open a browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"status": "running"}
```

### Step A6: Verify Dashboard Accessibility

Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000/
```

**Expected Result:**
- Redirects to `/login` page
- Login form displays with username/password fields
- Page title shows "Lab Management - Login"

---

## PHASE B: WINDOWS LAB PC SETUP

### Step B1: Install Python 3.12 (if not already installed)

1. On the lab workstation, download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Run the installer
3. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH"
4. Complete installation

Verify installation:
```cmd
python --version
```

Should output: `Python 3.12.x` or newer

### Step B2: Copy/Obtain LabManagement Project

Copy the `LabManagement` project folder to the workstation PC. Example path:
```
C:\LabManagement
```

Verify files exist:
```cmd
cd C:\LabManagement
dir
```

### Step B3: Run Windows Agent Setup Script

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**
2. Navigate to the project:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\LabManagement
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```
3. Run the setup script:
   ```powershell
   .\deploy\windows\setup_agent.ps1
   ```

The script will prompt for:
- **Server LAN URL**: Enter the IP from Step A1
  - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`
- **Agent Enrollment Token**: Enter the `LAB_AGENT_ENROLLMENT_SECRET` from `.env` on server
  - Must match exactly

### Step B4: Start the Lab Agent

**Option 1: Batch File (Easiest)**
```cmd
cd C:\LabManagement
.\deploy\windows\start_agent.bat
```

**Option 2: Direct Python**
```cmd
cd C:\LabManagement
set /p LAB_SERVER_URL=<.env
set /p LAB_AGENT_TOKEN=<.env
python -m agent.main
```

**Expected Output from Agent:**
```
2026-09-01 16:30:45 INFO Agent initialization starting...
2026-09-01 16:30:46 INFO Connected to server http://192.168.1.100:8000

## TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Agent won't connect to server | Check server IP is correct; verify firewall allows port 8000; ping server IP from workstation |
| Workstation appears OFFLINE immediately | Check agent token matches server enrollment secret exactly; verify network connectivity |
| Screen viewing shows blank frame | Agent might not have X11/desktop available; check agent logs for screenshot errors |
| Power command fails silently | Check LAB_POWER_DRY_RUN setting on both server and agent matches; verify agent has permissions |
| Dashboard won't load | Check server is running; try clearing browser cache; verify port 8000 is accessible |
| Tests hang during network discovery | Subnet scan might be slow on large networks; normal behavior up to 15 seconds |

---

## Notes for Manual Testing

- **Keep `LAB_POWER_DRY_RUN=true`** during all manual testing to prevent accidental system shutdown
- Test one phase completely before moving to the next
- Record any unexpected behavior or errors for troubleshooting
- If a phase fails, review server/agent logs for detailed error messages
- Network discovery may show more devices than expected (entire subnet is scanned)
