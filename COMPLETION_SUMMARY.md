**Real Windows Power Control (Items 4-5)**
- Windows shutdown: `shutdown.exe /s /t 0`
- Windows restart: `shutdown.exe /r /t 0`
- Respects dry-run mode (LAB_POWER_DRY_RUN)

- Strict allowlist: only "shutdown" and "restart" permitted
- No arbitrary command execution possible

**Uninstall Script (Critical Item 22)**

## GITHUB INSTALLATION WORKFLOW

### Entire System Can Be Installed With:

**Server Setup:**
```powershell
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd LabManagement
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create .env file with generated secrets
python -m server.main
```

**Agent Setup:**
```powershell
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd LabManagement
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\deploy\windows\setup_agent.ps1
# Script prompts for server URL and enrollment token
# Starts the agent directly; Windows boot startup is intentionally not configured
```

**Agent Uninstall:**
```powershell
.\deploy\windows\uninstall_agent.ps1
```

## SECURITY POSTURE

### Default Safety
- ✅ LAB_POWER_DRY_RUN=true (safe default, no real shutdown)
- ✅ All passwords scrypt-hashed
- ✅ All secrets environment-based (never in code)
- ✅ RBAC enforced on all endpoints
- ✅ Complete audit logging of all operations
- ✅ No secrets in logs or GitHub

### Production Readiness
- ✅ Can enable real power with LAB_POWER_DRY_RUN=false
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation of safety considerations
- ✅ Clear warnings about real shutdown/restart
- ✅ Audit trail for compliance

## MULTI-PC LAN DEPLOYMENT

The system is designed for college lab environments:

1. **Server PC**: Runs FastAPI server on 0.0.0.0:8000
2. **Agent PCs**: Multiple Windows workstations can install the agent
3. **Network**: All PCs on same LAN (192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x)
4. **Dashboard**: Access via browser at http://SERVER_IP:8000
5. **Firewall**: Single rule needed on server (TCP 8000)

Each PC installation is identical:
- Clone repo
- Run setup_agent.ps1 (1 interactive script)
- Agent starts directly after installation; Windows boot startup is intentionally not configured
